**Mission Accomplished**
- Installed all fuzz targets using `/root/gramatron-artifact/experiments/gt_bugs/create_targets_all.sh`
- Ran AflPlusPlus's Nautilus inspired custom mutator on mruby in `gramatron-artifact` docker environment
- Attempted to run AflPlusPlus's Nautilus inspired custom mutator to find PHP-1 bug, but time too long
- Instead ran AflPlusPlus's Nautilus inspired custom mutator to find mruby bug, too about 42 minutes. This verifies that AflPlusPlus can be run in this docker container.

**Attempting**

- Check Nautilus source code to see if seeds can be customized

Run Rust Nautilus command
`cd /root/gramatron-artifact/fuzzers/nt-fast_lbp && screen -d -m timeout 3600 cargo run --release -- -g /root/gramatron-artifact/grammars/gt_bugs/php-1/source_nt_gh.py -o /root/gramatron-artifact/results/gt_bugs/php-1/Nautilus_gh/output_000 -- /root/gramatron-artifact/targets/php-7.2.6_GFN/sapi/cli/php -f @@`
- Use beanstalk to pipeline running gramatron and grammar mutator

**Question**
- Why does AflPlusPlus's Grammar Mutator accept seeds? How does it parse the seeds into trees?
